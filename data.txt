important types of artificial neuron 
(the perceptron and the sigmoid neuron)

the standard learning algorithm for neural networks, known as stochastic gradient descent.

Perceptrons
So how do perceptrons work? A perceptron takes several binary inputs, x1,x2,…x1,x2,…, and produces a single binary output:
